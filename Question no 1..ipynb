    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Differences Between Interpreted and Dynamic Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept Focus:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Focuses on how the code is executedâ€”through an interpreter.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Focuses on how types and other features are handled at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Method:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Code execution can be by an interpreter or a compiler, but it allows for runtime type binding.\n",

    "- Type Checking:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Type checking can be static or dynamic, depending on the language.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Type checking is always done at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Often slower due to interpretation overhead.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Performance can vary; dynamic languages can be interpreted or compiled.\n",

    "Ans. The four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. These principles help in designing and structuring software systems that are modular, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    " - Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance\n",
    "- Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    " - Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    " - Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

    "# 22). How will you check if class is a child of another class ?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, you can check if a class is a child (subclass) of another class using the issubclass() function or the isinstance() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using issubclass()\n",
    " - The issubclass() function checks if a class is a derived class (subclass) of another class. It returns True if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument, and False otherwise.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Using isinstance()\n",
    " - The isinstance() function checks if an object is an instance of a class or a tuple of classes. While isinstance() is primarily used to check if an object is an instance of a class, it can also confirm if an object is an instance of a subclass."

    "Ans - When a class inherits from another class, it automatically gains access to the methods and attributes of the parent class. The child class can use, override, or extend these inherited methods and attributes.\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance - Definition: Single inheritance involves a single child class inheriting from a single parent class.\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance - Definition: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means a child class can have multiple parent classes.\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance - Definition: Multilevel inheritance involves a child class inheriting from a parent class, and then another child class inherits from the first child class, creating a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance - Definition: Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple child classes inheriting from the same parent class. This is useful when several classes share common behavior from a single base class.\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance - Definition: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. It can be a mix of any of the above types of inheritance. This can sometimes lead to complex inheritance structures."
