    "\n",

    "- Differences Between Interpreted and Dynamic Languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept Focus:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Focuses on how the code is executedâ€”through an interpreter.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Focuses on how types and other features are handled at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Method:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Code execution can be by an interpreter or a compiler, but it allows for runtime type binding.\n",

    "- Type Checking:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Type checking can be static or dynamic, depending on the language.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Language: Type checking is always done at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance:\n",
    "    - Interpreted Language: Often slower due to interpretation overhead.\n",

    "Ans. The four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. These principles help in designing and structuring software systems that are modular, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    " - Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance\n",
    "- Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    " - Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    " - Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

    "Ans. In Python, you can check if a class is a child (subclass) of another class using the issubclass() function or the isinstance() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using issubclass()\n",
    " - The issubclass() function checks if a class is a derived class (subclass) of another class. It returns True if the first argument is a subclass of the second argument, and False otherwise.\n",

    "2. Using isinstance()\n",
    " - The isinstance() function checks if an object is an instance of a class or a tuple of classes. While isinstance() is primarily used to check if an object is an instance of a class, it can also confirm if an object is an instance of a subclass."

    "Ans - When a class inherits from another class, it automatically gains access to the methods and attributes of the parent class. The child class can use, override, or extend these inherited methods and attributes.\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance - Definition: Single inheritance involves a single child class inheriting from a single parent class.\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance - Definition: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means a child class can have multiple parent classes.\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance - Definition: Multilevel inheritance involves a child class inheriting from a parent class, and then another child class inherits from the first child class, creating a chain of inheritance.\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance - Definition: Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple child classes inheriting from the same parent class. This is useful when several classes share common behavior from a single base class.\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance - Definition: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. It can be a mix of any of the above types of inheritance. This can sometimes lead to complex inheritance structures."

    "# 22. Explain PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION (PMF) and PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF). and what is the difference between them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF)** and **Probability Density Function (PDF)** are fundamental concepts in probability theory and statistics used to describe the distribution of random variables. They apply to different types of random variables and have distinct characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - The PMF is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - **Discrete Random Variables**: PMF applies to variables that take on a countable number of distinct values (e.g., the roll of a die, number of heads in coin flips).\n",
    "   - **Probability Assignment**: PMF assigns probabilities to each possible value of the discrete random variable.\n",
    "   - **Sum of Probabilities**: The sum of all probabilities given by the PMF for all possible values must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formula**:\n",
    "   - Let \\( X \\) be a discrete random variable. The PMF is denoted as \\( P(X = x) \\).\n",
    "   - The PMF function \\( p(x) \\) is defined as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     p(x) = P(X = x)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - For example, if \\( X \\) represents the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die, then \\( p(x) = \\frac{1}{6} \\) for \\( x \\) in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - The PDF is used for continuous random variables. It describes the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Characteristics**:\n",
    "   - **Continuous Random Variables**: PDF applies to variables that can take on an infinite number of values within a given range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
    "   - **Probability Density**: The PDF itself does not give probabilities directly. Instead, the area under the PDF curve over an interval gives the probability that the random variable falls within that interval.\n",
    "   - **Total Area**: The total area under the PDF curve over the entire range must equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formula**:\n",
    "   - Let \\( X \\) be a continuous random variable. The PDF is denoted as \\( f(x) \\).\n",
    "   - The probability that \\( X \\) falls within an interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - For example, for a standard normal distribution, the PDF is given by the normal distribution formula:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}\n",

    "   - **PMF**: Applies to discrete random variables.\n",
    "   - **PDF**: Applies to continuous random variables.\n",

    "2. **Probability Representation**:\n",
    "   - **PMF**: Gives the probability that a discrete random variable equals a specific value. The sum of probabilities for all possible values is 1.\n",
    "   - **PDF**: Provides a density value rather than a probability. The total area under the PDF curve is 1, and probabilities are found by integrating the PDF over a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Calculation**:\n",
    "   - **PMF**: Directly calculates the probability for discrete values.\n",
    "   - **PDF**: Requires integration over an interval to calculate the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visual Representation**:\n",
    "   - **PMF**: Typically visualized as a bar plot where each bar represents the probability of a discrete outcome.\n",
    "   - **PDF**: Typically visualized as a continuous curve where the area under the curve represents probabilities.\n"

    "# 23. What is correlation. Explain its type in details.what are the methods of determining correlation.\n",
    "**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Correlation helps in understanding whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Correlation**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Two variables are positively correlated if an increase in one variable tends to be associated with an increase in the other variable. Similarly, a decrease in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other.\n",
    "   - **Graphical Representation**: On a scatter plot, the points trend upwards from left to right.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Height and weight of individuals; as height increases, weight typically increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Negative Correlation**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Two variables are negatively correlated if an increase in one variable tends to be associated with a decrease in the other variable. Similarly, a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other.\n",
    "   - **Graphical Representation**: On a scatter plot, the points trend downwards from left to right.\n",
    "   - **Example**: The number of hours spent watching TV and academic performance; more hours of TV might be associated with lower grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero Correlation**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: There is no correlation between the variables if changes in one variable do not systematically affect the other variable.\n",
    "   - **Graphical Representation**: On a scatter plot, the points are scattered randomly without any discernible trend.\n",
    "   - **Example**: The color of a person's shoes and their income level; these variables are typically unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods of Determining Correlation\n",
    "\n",

    "     - \\( r = -1 \\): Perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "     - \\( r = 0 \\): No linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Measures the strength and direction of the association between two ranked variables. It is a non-parametric measure, used when the data is not normally distributed or when the relationship is not linear.\n",

    "# 28. What is Normal Distribution? What are the four Assumptions of Normal Distribution? Explain in detail.\n",
    "**Normal Distribution** is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It describes how the values of a variable are distributed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Normal Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Normal Distribution**, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve, where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and taper off towards the tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape**: The distribution is symmetric, meaning the left side of the distribution is a mirror image of the right side.\n",
    "2. **Mean, Median, Mode**: In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "3. **68-95-99.7 Rule**: Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n",
    "4. **Asymptotic**: The tails of the normal distribution approach the horizontal axis but never touch it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Four Assumptions of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset to be considered normally distributed, it generally needs to satisfy the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetry**:\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: The distribution of the variable is symmetric about its mean. This means that the left side of the distribution is a mirror image of the right side.\n",
    "   - **Implication**: The mean, median, and mode are all located at the same point in a perfectly normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **Implication in Practice**: Data points should be equally likely to fall above or below the mean, and the frequency distribution should look like a bell curve when graphed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean and Variance**:\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: The distribution is defined by its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). The mean determines the center of the distribution, and the variance measures the spread of the distribution.\n",
    "   - **Implication**: Any normal distribution can be described completely by specifying its mean and variance. The shape and position of the bell curve are determined by these parameters.\n",
    "   - **Implication in Practice**: The mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is the location of the peak of the bell curve, and the variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) determines the width of the bell curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Independence**:\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: Data points are independent of each other. This means that the value of one data point does not affect or influence the value of another.\n",
    "   - **Implication**: If the data points are not independent, the normal distribution model may not be applicable, as the correlation between data points would need to be accounted for.\n",
    "   - **Implication in Practice**: Collect data such that each observation is independent of others, or use methods that account for dependencies if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Outliers**:\n",
    "   - **Assumption**: The dataset does not contain outliers. Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from the rest of the data.\n",
    "   - **Implication**: Outliers can distort the normality of the data distribution, making it skewed or producing a distribution with heavy tails.\n",
    "   - **Implication in Practice**: Examine the data for outliers before assuming a normal distribution. Statistical tests or graphical methods, like Q-Q plots, can be used to identify outliers.\n"

    "# 29.Write all the characteristics or Properties of the Normal Distribution Curve.\n",
    "The normal distribution curve, also known as the Gaussian curve, has several key characteristics and properties that define its shape and behavior. Here are the primary characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Bell-Shaped Curve**\n",
    "   - The curve is symmetric and bell-shaped. The highest point of the curve is at the mean, and it tapers off equally in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Symmetry**\n",
    "   - The normal distribution curve is perfectly symmetric around its mean (\\(\\mu\\)). This means that the left and right halves of the curve are mirror images of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mean, Median, and Mode**\n",
    "   - In a normal distribution, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)), median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution. This central point represents the peak of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Asymptotic**\n",
    "   - The tails of the normal distribution curve approach the horizontal axis but never actually touch it. This means that the probability of extreme values is never zero, but it becomes very small as you move further from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule)**\n",
    "   - Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of the mean.\n",
    "   - Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "   - Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Total Area Under the Curve**\n",
    "   - The total area under the normal distribution curve is equal to 1. This represents the total probability of all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Standard Normal Distribution**\n",
    "   - A special case of the normal distribution is the standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is denoted as \\(Z\\)-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Mean and Variance**\n",
    "   - The normal distribution is defined by its mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the variance determines the spread or width of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Probability Density Function (PDF)**\n",
    "   - The probability density function of a normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - This function describes the likelihood of a value occurring within a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**\n",
    "   - The cumulative distribution function represents the probability that a random variable \\(X\\) will take a value less than or equal to \\(x\\). It is the integral of the PDF from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(x\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Inflection Points**\n",
    "   - The curve has two inflection points where the curvature changes direction. These points are located one standard deviation away from the mean (\\(\\mu - \\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu + \\sigma\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **68-95-99.7 Rule Application**\n",
    "   - The percentages of data falling within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean are approximate values that apply to any normal distribution, regardless of mean or standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Z-Scores**\n",
    "   - In a normal distribution, Z-scores (standard scores) measure how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. They follow the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Parameter Estimation**\n",
    "   - The parameters (mean and standard deviation) of the normal distribution can be estimated from sample data using statistical methods.\n"

    "# 34. What is the statistical hypothesis? Explain the errors in hypothesis testing.b)Explain the Sample. What are Large Samples & Small Samples?\n",
    "### Statistical Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "A statistical hypothesis is a statement or assumption about a population parameter that can be tested using statistical methods. It is used in hypothesis testing to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Hypotheses:**\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))**: The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect or no difference, and it serves as the default or baseline hypothesis. It assumes that any observed effect or difference is due to random chance.\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\) or \\(H_a\\))**: The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It suggests that there is an effect or a difference, and it is what the researcher aims to provide evidence for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Errors in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "1. **Type I Error (False Positive)**:\n",
    "   - Occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true.\n",
    "   - This is also known as a false positive.\n",
    "   - The probability of committing a Type I error is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha), also known as the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type II Error (False Negative)**:\n",
    "   - Occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false.\n",
    "   - This is also known as a false negative.\n",
    "   - The probability of committing a Type II error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\) (beta), and the power of the test is \\(1 - \\beta\\), which measures the test's ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "A sample is a subset of individuals or observations drawn from a larger population. It is used to estimate or infer characteristics of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Samples:**\n",
    "1. **Large Samples**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A sample is considered large when it contains a sufficient number of observations to provide reliable estimates and to apply the Central Limit Theorem effectively.\n",
    "   - **Typically**: A sample size of 30 or more is often considered large in many statistical analyses, though this can vary based on the context and the specific statistical methods used.\n",
    "   - **Characteristics**: Large samples tend to produce more accurate estimates of population parameters and are less affected by outliers. They also allow for the application of normal distribution approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Small Samples**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A sample is considered small when it contains a limited number of observations, which may not provide as reliable estimates of population parameters.\n",
    "   - **Typically**: A sample size of less than 30 is often considered small, though the exact threshold can vary.\n",
    "   - **Characteristics**: Small samples may have higher variability and are more susceptible to the influence of outliers. They often require different statistical techniques, such as t-tests, to account for the smaller sample size and potential deviations from normality.\n"
